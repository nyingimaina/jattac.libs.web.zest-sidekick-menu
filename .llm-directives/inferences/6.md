# Inferred Project Goals and Developer Preferences (Session 6)

This document captures additional key goals and preferences inferred from our recent development interactions, building upon the previous sets of principles.

## New Inferences

1.  **Profound Understanding of CSS Layout Contexts is Essential for Robust UI Development:**
    *   **Observation:** The project demands a very deep and precise understanding of how different CSS `display` properties interact, especially within the context of HTML table elements. Incorrect application of layout models can lead to severe and unexpected visual regressions.
    
2.  **Careful Consideration of HTML Structural Changes and Their Cascading CSS Impact:**
    *   **Observation:** Even seemingly minor modifications to the HTML structure of a component can have significant and unintended consequences on its styling and layout, requiring meticulous attention to detail.
    

3.  **Systematic Debugging of Layout Regressions is Crucial for Maintaining UI Integrity:**
    *   **Observation:** The ability to quickly diagnose and rectify severe layout regressions is paramount for maintaining the visual integrity and functionality of the application. This requires a methodical approach to debugging CSS and HTML interactions.
