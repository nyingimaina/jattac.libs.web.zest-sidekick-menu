# Inferred Project Goals and Developer Preferences (Session 3: Deep Code Understanding & Debugging)

This document captures key goals and preferences inferred from interactions that required a deep dive into the codebase's intricacies and debugging across different layers of the application.

## Key Inferences

1.  **Expectation of Deep Code-Level Understanding for Effective Problem Solving:**
    *   **Observation:** There is a clear expectation that the development agent (me) possesses a granular and precise understanding of the project's internal implementation details. This extends beyond high-level architecture to specific framework patterns, styling methodologies, and type system nuances.
    

2.  **Multi-Layer Debugging Capability is Essential:**
    *   **Observation:** The project demands the ability to debug issues that span across different technological layers of the application. Problems are not confined to a single domain (e.g., just React logic or just CSS) but often involve interactions between them.
    

These inferences reinforce the existing principles of "Developer Experience (DX) is a Top Priority" and "Robust & Extensible Architecture," as precise code-level understanding and multi-layer debugging capabilities are fundamental to maintaining a high-quality and efficient development process.
