# Inferred Project Goals and Developer Preferences (Session 2: Initial Feature Implementation & API Refinement)

This document captures key goals and preferences inferred from early development interactions, focusing on the initial implementation of new features and the refinement of their programmatic interfaces.

## Key Inferences

1.  **Immediate UI Feedback is Crucial for User Experience:**
    *   **Observation:** There is a strong emphasis on ensuring that any user interaction with the application's interface provides immediate and clear visual feedback.

2.  **Precision in API Documentation is Paramount for Developer Adoption:**
    *   **Observation:** A high value is placed on the accuracy, precision, and completeness of the API documentation. This extends beyond providing functional examples to ensuring that every aspect of the API contract (e.g., function signatures, return types, parameter expectations) is explicitly and correctly detailed.
    *   **Example Scenario:** During the development of a sorting plugin, a specific query arose regarding the expected return type of a `sortComparer` function. The immediate expectation was that this detail should be clearly and unambiguously documented within the API reference, including its `number` return type, consistent with standard JavaScript comparison functions. This ensures that developers integrating the library can do so efficiently and without ambiguity, reducing friction and potential errors.

3.  **Proactive Problem Resolution is Essential for Development Velocity:**
    *   **Observation:** When discrepancies, bugs, or unexpected behaviors are identified, there is a clear and immediate expectation for their investigation and resolution. This proactive approach aims to maintain development momentum and prevent issues from compounding.
    

4.  **Iterative Refinement is Key to Achieving API Elegance:**
    *   **Observation:** The process of designing and implementing the library's API is highly iterative, with a strong drive towards achieving the most elegant, type-safe, and boilerplate-free solutions. This involves continuously seeking improvements to the developer experience.
