# Inferred Project Goals and Developer Preferences (Session 5)

This document captures additional key goals and preferences inferred from our recent development interactions, building upon the previous sets of principles.

## New Inferences

1.  **Emphasis on Subtle Micro-Interactions for Enhanced UX:**
    *   **Observation:** The project places significant value on refining even the smallest user interface details, such as the behavior of the mouse pointer and the visual feedback on interactive elements. This goes beyond basic functionality to create a "delightful" and "polished" user experience.
   
2.  **Preference for Performant, CSS-Driven UI Effects:**
    *   **Observation:** There is a clear preference for implementing UI effects and visual cues using pure CSS whenever feasible, rather than relying on JavaScript. This approach is chosen for its benefits in performance, maintainability, and theming flexibility.
    
3.  **Iterative Refinement as a Core Development Practice:**
    *   **Observation:** The development process involves continuous iteration and refinement, particularly for UI/UX aspects. Feedback on subtle visual or interactive discrepancies leads to further adjustments until the desired level of polish is achieved.
